# Password-Generator-Challenge

First project using JS to generate random passwords of varying lengths and with different character modifiers.

For this project we were tasked with developing the JavaScript to run a random secure password generator. The user needed to be able on click of the "generate password" button to determine the length of the password as well as whether or not to include one or all of the following: upper/lower case letters, numbers, and/or special characters.

By assigning variables to string of the above character types, and then calling them with prompts to store their values. I then ran those chosen strings of characters through 'if' statements to concatenate them and develop a pool of available charaters to then choose from randomly to generate a password. This function was then executed by the starter code.
